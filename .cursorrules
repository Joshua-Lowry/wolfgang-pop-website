# Wolfgang Pop Website - Cursor AI Agent Rules

## Project Overview
This is the Wolfgang Pop website - a v1 marketing site for a local popcorn stand brand.

## Critical Rules

### 1. Read Specification First
- **ALWAYS read `docs/SPEC.md` in full before starting any task**
- The specification is the single source of truth for this project
- Do not assume requirements beyond what is written in the spec

### 2. Scope Boundaries
- This is a Version 1 (v1) website with strict scope limitations
- **DO NOT add features not explicitly listed in the spec**
- If a feature is not in the "Included in v1" section, it is out of scope
- Do not add "improvements" without explicit approval

### 3. Development Workflow
- **NEVER commit directly to `main`**
- Always create feature branches: `git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name`
- Push changes to test branches for review
- Only merge to `main` after approval
- Use clear, descriptive commit messages

### 4. Tech Stack (Non-Negotiable)
- Next.js 14 with App Router
- TypeScript for all source files
- Tailwind CSS 3.4.1 for styling
- No additional UI frameworks or CSS libraries
- No databases or CMS in v1

### 5. Project Structure
- Pages: `/src/app/`
- Components: `/src/components/`
- Utilities: `/src/lib/`
- **Do not reorganize without approval**

### 6. Brand Colors (Approved Only)
Use ONLY these colors:
- Butter Yellow: `#F3E1A4` (use `butter-yellow` in Tailwind)
- Plum Purple: `#4B2E83` (use `plum-purple` in Tailwind)
- Charcoal: `#1F1F1F` (use `charcoal` in Tailwind)
- Warm Gray: `#9B9B9B` (use `warm-gray` in Tailwind)

**No other colors may be introduced.**

### 7. Code Quality
- Keep code simple and readable
- Avoid unnecessary abstraction
- Ensure `pnpm run build` succeeds without errors
- Resolve all warnings before completing work

### 8. Pages (v1 Scope)
Only these pages should exist:
1. Home (`/`)
2. Menu (`/menu`)
3. About (`/about`)
4. Contact (`/contact`)

### 9. Explicitly Excluded from v1
Do NOT implement:
- Online ordering or payments
- User accounts or authentication
- Databases or CMS systems
- Admin dashboards
- Blog functionality
- Advanced animations
- Third-party UI frameworks beyond Tailwind CSS

### 10. When Unclear
- If a requirement is unclear or missing, **STOP and ask for clarification**
- Do not guess or interpret beyond what is written
- Prefer simple solutions over complex ones

## Definition of Done
Work is complete when:
- ✅ All pages exist and render correctly
- ✅ Navigation works between all pages
- ✅ Site is responsive and mobile-friendly
- ✅ Contact form sends emails successfully
- ✅ Branding follows approved guidelines
- ✅ No out-of-scope features added
- ✅ `pnpm run build` succeeds without errors
- ✅ All changes committed and pushed to feature branch

## Tone & Style
- Friendly and approachable
- Clear and straightforward
- Confident but not salesy
- Local and human, not corporate

## Remember
**You are not permitted to reinterpret or override the specification. Follow `docs/SPEC.md` exactly.**
